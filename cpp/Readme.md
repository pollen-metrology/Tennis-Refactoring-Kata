# Tennis-Refactoring-Kata C++

## Using CMake, under Windows

Sample setup (in a Windows console, using Git), and considering you are already located in this folder:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
Tennis-Refactoring.sln
```

Visual Studio should start with the projects in it.
You will have three different project, each one for a specific version of initial source code (1, 2 and 3).
Tests are already complete, code is ready to refactor!
